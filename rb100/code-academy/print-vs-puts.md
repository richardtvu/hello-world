# Print VS Puts

The `print` command is going to just repeat the input without any additional changes. By contrast, the `puts` command will repeat the input and add a new line at the end.

For instance, `print "Hello world"` outputs "Hello world" . 
`puts "Hello world"` outputs "Hello world
".
- Notice that the end of the string is on a new line.
