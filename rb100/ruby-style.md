# What are some Ruby style guidelines?

- Use two spaces for tabs.
- Anything with a hash symbol before it is a comment.
- Use `snake_case` say for defining methods, variables, and files. 
- Use `ALLCAPS` for constants, e.g. `PI = 3.14`.
- Use `{}` for one-liner blocks.
- Wrap multi-line blocks with `do ... end`. 
- Use `PascalCase` for naming classes.
