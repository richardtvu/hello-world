The second a vantage is I will learn different ways to learn a programming in which, which basically means I'll be improving my ability to learn how to learn. I am passionate about learning how to learn because I realize that this will help me with every other expect in my life. Therefore, the ruby track is a better fit for my values of learning and growing over the long term.
