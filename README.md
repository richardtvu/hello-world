# README #

I consider myself a new programmer and new to ruby. Therefore, I will take my time through the **Programming with Ruby** book and the **assignments**.

These notes are going to be my scratch notes, so they may be wrong, or not organized. I'm choosing to make my learning public https://learninpublic.org/v1-principles-learn-in-public.pdf for account ability, and the potential to grow over time with feedback. However, I consider myself a beginner (despite having a jr. developer job already) and want to make it clear that this repository is a _learning_ repository, not a professional resource.
