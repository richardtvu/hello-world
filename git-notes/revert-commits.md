# Revert Commits

Some things I've found useful include being able to revert my commits: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-revert-commit-how-to-undo-the-last-commit/. 

You might find this command useful as well:

  `git reset --soft HEAD~1`. 
  
This command will reset the head while still keeping the changes that you made locally. Then, you will have the option to re-add your changes with the correct commits.
