How would you use the upcase method to uppercase the string "xyz"?

- Search for the `upcase` method in the core Ruby documentation and go to the [String class](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.5/String.html#method-i-upcase).
- Note that the example has `"hEllO".upcase   #=> "HELLO"`. 
- Therefore, I would simply put a dot upcase after the string I want to uppercase. 
- `result="xyz".upcase`
